Target soundness statement:
If "verifast A.c B.c C.c" succeeds, then "gcc -o ./program.exe A.c B.c C.c && ./program.exe" does not throw any assertion failures.

Known VeriFast unsoundnesses:
- integer overflow
- linking correctness (i.e. all modules of a program use the same contracts for the same functions)
- variable hiding might cause problems; should be forbidden
- contracts of lock_acquire and lock_release (non-re-entrant, non-thread-affine) not consistent with implementation (re-entrant, thread-affine)
