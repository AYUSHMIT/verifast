C Programs
==========

Target soundness statement:
If "verifast A.c B.c C.c" succeeds, then "gcc -o ./program.exe A.c B.c C.c && ./program.exe" does not throw any assertion failures.

Known VeriFast unsoundnesses:
- linking correctness: ensure header files have the same meaning in all modules
- linking correctness: prevent duplicate struct definitions and duplicate predicate definitions
- predicate preciseness analysis: does not deal correctly with the local variable scopes induced by conditional assertions and switch assertions
- disallow the use of regular function pointers as predicate family indices in unloadable modules. (Note: using lemma function pointers as predicate family indices is fine.)

Java Programs
=============

Target soundness statement:
If "javac A.java B.java C.java" succeeds, and program.jarsrc contains the following lines:

A.java
B.java
C.java
main-class A

and "verifast -c program.jarsrc" succeeds, then "java A" does not throw any assertion failures.

Known VeriFast unsoundnesses:
- Java: ClassCastExceptions are currently not prevented
- ghost variables (which can hide fields) can appear in the argument of the Java assert statement
- Spec of List.remove: this method uses Object.equals instead of == but the spec assumes it uses ==
