Target soundness statement:
If "verifast A.c B.c C.c" succeeds, then "gcc -o ./program.exe A.c B.c C.c && ./program.exe" does not throw any assertion failures.

Known VeriFast unsoundnesses:
- linking correctness: if a module depends on the axiom generated by a lemma_auto but does not call it explicitly, no requires directive is emitted into the module's vfmanifest. In other words, there is nothing that forces lemma_autos to be implemented.
- linking correctness: ensure header files have the same meaning in all modules
- linking correctness: prevent duplicate struct definitions and duplicate predicate definitions
- predicate preciseness analysis: does not deal correctly with the local variable scopes induced by conditional assertions and switch assertions
- casts in specification elements: for now casts are allowed in the specification of Java programs, this should be disabled in the future.
- disallow the use of regular function pointers as predicate family indices in unloadable modules. (Note: using lemma function pointers as predicate family indices is fine.)
- Java: ClassCastExceptions are currently not prevented
- ghost variables (which can hide fields) can appear in the argument of the Java assert statement
