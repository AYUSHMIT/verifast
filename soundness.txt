Target soundness statement:
If "verifast A.c B.c C.c" succeeds, then "gcc -o ./program.exe A.c B.c C.c && ./program.exe" does not throw any assertion failures.

Known VeriFast unsoundnesses:
- linking correctness: ensure header files have the same meaning in all modules
- linking correctness: prevent duplicate struct definitions and duplicate predicate definitions
