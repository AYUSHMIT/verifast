Building VeriFast on Linux
==========================

I successfully built VeriFast on Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex, released in October 2008) after apt-getting the following packages and their dependencies:

subversion
ocaml-nox
ocaml-native-compilers
liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev
camlidl

Just type 'make' in the 'src' directory.
