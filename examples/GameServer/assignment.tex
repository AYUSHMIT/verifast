\section{Assignment}
The goal of this assignment is to verify a game server. More specifically, you must add annotations to \texttt{GameServer.c} such that the VeriFast program verifier accepts the program. Modifying the source code itself or using \texttt{assume} statements is not permitted. It is not necessary for specifications to be complete; it suffices to prove the absence of memory errors and data races.

Your final solution must be submitted to \texttt{bart.jacobs@cs.kuleuven.be} by March 7th 2010. It suffices to send the annotated version of \texttt{GameServer.c}. If you get stuck, you can request hints by sending an email describing your problem to \texttt{bart.jacobs@cs.kuleuven.be}.

\section{Hints}

\begin{itemize}
  \item To verify memory safety of pointer dereference \texttt{*p}, VeriFast looks for a heap chunk \texttt{pointer(p, \_)}. \texttt{prelude.h} contains various lemmas to create and manipulate \texttt{pointer} chunks.
\end{itemize}
